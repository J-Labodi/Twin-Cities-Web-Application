<!--Numbers are associated to each relation. The index is city->0, category->1, image->2 and poi->3. This is done in order to avoid the
repetition of code, as the indexes correspond to their places in the global array. In this file the two main functions are called on all
of these relation.
- The first method makeXML() transfers the data from dsa_twincities database into an XML file
- The second method xml_to_rss() converts the same XML file into a RSS feed and deletes the XML file
