            The Electric is a cinema in Birmingham, England. It opened in Station Street in 1909, showing its first silent film on 27 December of that year, and as of 2022 is thought to be the oldest working cinema in the country. It predates its namesake, the Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, London, by around two months. Originally called the Electric Theatre, the cinema has undergone a number of name changes since its opening, but returned as The Electric in October 1993. The cinema closed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the owner making most of its staff redundant. In January 2022 it the cinema reopened under new ownership.
