        <component type="PHP Coding">
            <contributor id="18026465"/>
            <description> Building our data driven web application required to create the main structure in PHP 
                that consists of various functionalities such as displaying maps of the chosen twin cities, 
                generating display of the current and forecast weather and representing a RSS feed related to 
                the current dataset held in the database. The application also makes use of an additional configuration file 
                coded in PHP that contains various application-wide data such as relevant information to complete API requests.
                During development, the initially completed Twin Cities weather project given the starting point of 
                the gradually extended, final web application. Obtaining the desired weather information from OpenWeatherMap required 
                to generate the appropriate API call and access the requested XML data that may be displayed within the tables that 
                have been generated in PHP via embedded HTML. The accessed data is stored in arrays and a fraction of the information
                is defined as a constant, depending on the nature of the data. Data from XML requires formatting before it is presented
                within the generated tables. Various PHP built in functions used to complete this task. Eventually, the completed 
                weather application has been extended with the Twin Cities Map section that employs JavaScript. The team members have
                equally divided the group tasks of the project followed by merging the Twin Cities Map and RSS feed components with 
                the initially completed Weather section. GitHub employed to store the project files along with using a designated WhatsApp
                group to discuss occurring obstacles during development or post updates on the progression
                in the assigned tasks. </description>
            <problems> The team members have not experienced any major obstacles during the development of the PHP code,
                although implementing some features appeared to be more challenging than others. A great example for this is representing the
                forecast data in the Twin Cities Weather section. The XML data related to the weather forecast contains live weather updates of
                every 3 hours, although our design required to display the weather forecast of the upcoming 5 days, representing data related 
                only to midday and midnight. </problems>
            <solutions> Our PHP code includes a foreach loop that iterates through the forecast data presented in XML format, 
                filters the midday and midnight forecast values via a selection that contains code to push the desired forecast data into the relevant array.
                The content of these arrays may be accessed to represent the correct weather forecast of the upcoming 5 days, displaying only
                the midday and midnight temperatures. </solutions>

        <component type="CSS Design">
            <contributor id="18026465"/>
            <description> Initially, the project included an external CSS stylesheet that contained all the selectors and declarations to customise
                the look of our web application. The layout has been divided into divisions within a “Wrapper” element that allows us to declare and position
                the different blocks as inline-block. This layout design represented the twin cities alongside each other, providing appropriate arrangements
                of the represented elements. This stylesheet also included various style declarations, targeting headings with different sizes, tables and
                its elements and the representation of Twin Cities Maps. Designing the layout of the web application and styling its elements has been completed
                by one group member that volunteered to improve the look of the web application.Eventually, this initially created CSS stylesheet has been discarded
                as the design of the web application has been improved further by completing the individual task of refactoring the web application by applying 
                responsive design through Bootstrap. </description>
            <problems> The web application has not been responsive to different screen sizes and the targeted elements required a considerable amount of padding
                to provide an acceptable overall look. Appropriately aligning the elements of the individual divisions without the employment of any specific CSS framework
                appeared to be a truly challenging task. </problems>
            <solutions> The front-end has been refactored to be responsive within one of the selected individual tasks. Utilising Bootstrap framework
                allowed us to easily obtain changes in design by targeting specific divisions of the web application through the predefined
                classes of Bootstrap. </solutions>

    <!-- something about any learning outcomes achieved and any other overall comments -->
    <overall_comments> 
        The group members have gained a solid base of knowledge in the process of designing databases and implementing it within a web based application.
        We have successfully gained an understanding of Conceptual and Logical ER models including the identification and representation of entities, attributes and relationships.
        The team members have also gained  a great amount of experience in database implementation and working with external APIs. 
        As for the programming languages that we utilised for this project, the majority of team members did not have any prior experience in PHP
        and developing the backbone of our web application in this language helped us to gain a comprehensive understanding of its syntax and the potential of
        utilising PHP in web development.
