        <p class="ex1">Opened on July 20, 1988 as an eight screener in the Webster Place shopping center (located on Webster Avenue, off Lincoln Parks Clybourn Avenue Corridor), the theater was built for M & R Amusements, but that local chain was acquired by Loews not long after the multiplex opened.

            In 1998, three more screens were added, increasing the theatre to eleven screens. In 2006, the Webster Place became part of the Kerasotes chain. The Webster Place received a much-needed remodeling in fall of 2007.
            
            On May 25, 2010, it was taken over by Regal Entertainment. AMC acquired certain Kerasotes theatre locations, including this one, then sold them on to Regal.</p>
