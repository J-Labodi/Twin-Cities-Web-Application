            Birmingham Airport (IATA: BHX, ICAO: EGBB), formerly Birmingham International Airport, is an international airport located 7 nautical miles (13 km; 8.1 mi) east-southeast of Birmingham city centre, 9.5 nautical miles (17.6 km; 10.9 mi) west-northwest of Coventry slightly north of Bickenhill village in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, England.
            Officially opened as Elmdon Airport on 8 July 1939, the airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry during Second World War and used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy as RAF Elmdon. It was largely used for flight training and wartime production purposes. On 8 July 1946, the aerodrome was reopened to civilian operations.           
            Birmingham Airport currently holds a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P451) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. Passenger throughput in 2017 was over 12.9 million, making Birmingham the seventh busiest airport in the UK. The airport offers international flights to destinations in Europe,
             the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, North America, and the Caribbean. Birmingham Airport is an operating base for Jet2.com, Ryanair and TUI Airways.
